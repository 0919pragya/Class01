[PROD] [ALERT] [TDATA] Sentinel process - CPU Utilization high

Steps of Resolution:
Follow the resolution steps for the issue: Sentinel process, located on this wiki page: https://wiki.web.att.com/display/TdataStreams/Frequent+PROD+Issues

If Alert subject say [PROD] [ALERT] [TDATA]/[TDICE]/[SDP] Sentinel process - CPU Utilization high
Usually this alert should associate with Grafana alert or some other server alerts. monitor closely with other alerts and follow the protocol of those alerts. in Addition, follow this SoR as following.
Login to the server on which the Sentinel process failed according to the alert.
Run the top command and check if the s1-perf is in the top 5 process
If yes then - Run the pipeline - https://az-community-four.vci.att.com/jenkins/job/com.att.icapsdp/job/Under_Construction/job/Ansible/job/Sentinel_pipeline_Prod/
Continue Monitor CPU status on Grafana. After 1 hour, only if the CPU status is back to normal, re-start the Sentinel process thru the pipeline.
